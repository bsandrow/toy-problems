# Toy Problems

A collection of 'toy problem' solutions. Basically solutions to interview-type
questions. Sometimes these are basically the implementations that I have given
to such problems, other times they are improvements that I've made after the
fact because I was frustrated that a particular problem stumped me (or that I
abandoned the approach that I wanted to take due to the interview format).
